      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m excited to introduce ScreenEnv, a breakthrough python library that’s redefining what’s possible in desktop automation and AI agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "💥 The problem we solved:\n",
      "Building desktop agents used to be a nightmare - clunky VMs, brittle scripts, expensive cloud setups. Most developers avoided GUI automation because… it just wasn’t worth the pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 What ScreenEnv changes:\n",
      "\n",
      " 🖥️ Full desktop control\n",
      "Agents can now see, click, type, launch apps, manage windows, handle files and even record full sessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "🤖 AI-Native by design\n",
      "Built for modern infrastructure with Model Context Protocol (MCP) support or a simple Sandbox API for smooth integration.\n",
      "\n",
      "🐳 Instant setup\n",
      "Forget complex configs, just run it in docker. Get a full desktop environment up in less than 10 seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔒 Sandboxed & Safe\n",
      "Runs in isolated containers. Perfect for testing, deploying, or benchmarking without touching your host.\n",
      "\n",
      "The real breakthrough?\n",
      "You can now build agents that interact with applications, generate content, manage files, browse the web, and automate multi-step workflows all in real desktop environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who should care:\n",
      "✅ QA teams — automate GUI testing with precision\n",
      "✅ Businesses — AI agents that handle repetitive desktop tasks\n",
      "✅ Developers — true cross-platform automation with zero boilerplate\n",
      "✅ Researchers — reproducible, controlled environments for agent evaluation\n",
      "And yes — it’s built to plug seamlessly into your existing stack.\n",
      "\n",
      "🙏 Huge thanks to my teammate\n",
